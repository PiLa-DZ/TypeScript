// ============================================================
// Any
// TypeScript has a special type, any, that you can use whenever you don’t want a particular value to cause typechecking errors.
// When a value is of type any, you can access any properties of it (which will in turn be of type any), call it like a function, assign it to (or from) a value of any type, or pretty much anything else that’s syntactically legal:

let obj: any = { x: 0 };
// None of the following lines of code will throw compiler errors.
// Using `any` disables all further type checking, and it is assumed
// you know the environment better than TypeScript.
obj.foo();
obj();
obj.bar = 100;
obj = 'hello';
const n: number = obj;

// ============================================================
// Unknown
// unknown is the type-safe counterpart of any. Anything is assignable to unknown, but unknown isn’t assignable to anything but itself and any without a type assertion or a control flow based narrowing. Likewise, no operations are permitted on an unknown without first asserting or narrowing to a more specific type.
function f1(a: any) {
  a.b(); // OK
}

function f2(a: unknown) {
  // Error: Property 'b' does not exist on type 'unknown'.
  a.b();
}
